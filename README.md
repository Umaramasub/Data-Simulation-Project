##Introduction:
Current literature highlights the importance of participating in regular physical activity and limiting sedentary time for positive health outcomes.Although several studies have examined the association between sedentary time and specific chronic diseases, few have examined overall time spent sitting on the association with a range of chronic diseases, particularly in middle-aged males.

The aim of this study was to build upon an existing and growing body of literature on sitting time - and the association of this modifiable lifestyle behaviour with a range of chronic diseases. This study utilised a large sample of middle-aged males and statistically controlled for a range of associated covariates, including age, BMI, and functional limitation.

##Study methodology:

It was a retrospective study with data derived from baseline questionnaire that provides insight into an extensive range of health conditions and underlying determinants of health. Participants were randomly sampled from the Medicare Australia (national health insurance) database between February 2006 and December 2008.Data on all variables included in this analysis were derived from self-report measures. Participants were included in the Study if they completed a mailed baseline questionnaire and provided their signed consent for participation in the baseline questionnaire and long-term follow-up.

For the purpose of the current study, cancer (which included prostate cancer and other cancers, but did not include melanoma or non-melanoma skin cancer), heart disease, diabetes, and hypertension were used as primary outcome variables (binary presence or absence of each disease), as evidence suggests that time spent sedentary is associated with these, and other conditions. In addition, an overall chronic disease variable combining the diseases listed above was computed (binary presence or absence of any chronic disease, among those listed) and analysed in a separate model.

Total sitting time was determined by asking participants to record the total amount of time, in hours, they usually spent sitting per day, and values were divided into quartiles of 0 to <4 hours, 4 to <6 hours, 6 to <8 hours, and ???8 hours of sitting time per day. This particular question has not been assessed for reliability and validity.

Participants were asked to report on their participation in three types of physical activity, with a reference period of the previous week "walking continuously, for at least 10 minutes (for recreation or exercise or to get to or from places)"; "vigorous physical activity (that made you breathe harder or puff and pant, like jogging, cycling, aerobics, competitive tennis, but not household chores or gardening)"; and "moderate physical activity (like gentle swimming, social tennis, vigorous gardening or work around the house)" - by recording the total duration and the total number of times they participated in each.For the current study, the total time spent in these activities was used to determine participants' physical activity levels, with minutes of vigorous physical activity given double weighting.

Highest educational qualification was self-reported, with options including no qualifications, school or higher school certificate, trade or apprenticeship, certificate or diploma, and university degree.

Questionnaire respondents indicated whether they had been a regular smoker in the past, and smoking status was categorised as 'ever'(1) or 'never'(0).

BMI (kg/m2) was calculated from participants' self-reported height and weight measurements, and cut-points developed by the WHO were used to determine underweight (<18.50kg/m2), normal weight (18.50-24.99kg/m2), overweight (25.00-29.99kg/m2) and obese (???30.00kg/m2) categories Functional limitation was measured using the Medical Outcomes Study Physical Functioning (MOS-PF) scale, which assesses the extent to which an individuals' health limits their ability to perform daily functional activities.

Functional limitation scores (out of 100) were divided into 4 categories: no limitation (100), minor limitation (95-99), moderate limitation (85-94) and severe limitation (0-84). The MOS-PF has been shown to have good test-retest reliability and content validity as a measure of physical functioning

##Predictor variables:

1.Age: As a continuous variable from 45 to 64year only males 2.Smoking status as a factor with 2 levels: Never or Ever
3.BMI as factor variable with 4 levels : Underweight,Normal weight, Overweight,Obese 4.Functional limitation with 4 levels: No limitation,Minor limitation,Moderate limitation,Severe limitation	5.Total sitting time as a factor variable of 4 levels: 0 to <4 hours, 4 to <6 hours, 6 to <8 hours, and greater 8 hours of sitting time per day
6.Five distinct physical activity categories 0 (no physical activity); 1 to 149 minutes of physical activity (insufficient levels); 150 to 299 minutes of physical activity (sufficient levels); 300 to 539 minutes (highly active); and greater 540 minutes (very highly active) of physical activity in the previous week 7. Educational Qualification: Factor variable with 5 levels of education as shown below
None,School Certificate,HSC,Trade/apprenticeship,certificate/diploma.University Degree

##Response variables: Chronic diseases will include cancer,heart disease, diabetes, and hypertension recorded as a binary presence or absence of each disease.
Functional limitations can potentially confound physical activity level. The presence of chronic disease, however, often brings with it some decline in functional limitation Individuals who experience higher degrees of limitation may be less likely to participate in physical activity, and may consequently spend more time in sedentary behaviours such as sitting. Adding functional limitation in the final model will allow us to explore the unique contribution of this potentially confounding variable, while still controlling for additional covariates. Sitting time is also correlated with functional limitation. Patients with higher functional limitation will tend to spend more time sitting.

In addition some noise was added to the simulated data, as some individuals may tend to under or over report their duration of sitting, functional limitations and physical activity level
